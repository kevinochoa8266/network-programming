# Bryan Torreblanca Contribution:

I have implemented a feature that reads the Common.cfg and PeerInfo.cfg files. This ensures that essential variables, such as peer information and common configuration settings, are correctly set for each peer.
I helped implement a crucial aspect of the program where each peer initiates TCP connections with all peers that started before it. This functionality is crucial for creating the peer network required for file sharing. 
Also, I collaborated with my peers to get as much work done as possible and I believe we all contributed equally to the project.

# Ryan Rodriguez Contribution:

To adhere to the protocol, I have implemented a handshake message exchange between connected peers. This ensures a secure initiation of communication between peers.
I attempted the implementation of exchanging bitfield messages, a critical component for peers to understand each other's available pieces and facilitate the sharing process. 
I attempted sends 'interested' or 'not interested' messages as required by the protocol, reflecting the dynamic interests of peers in the shared file. I helped my group with debugging and coding through discord sessions and screen sharing as well.


# Kevin Ochoa Contribution:
I created the skeleton code for the project and the set up. I helped implement a crucial aspect of the program where each peer initiates TCP connections with all peers that started before it. This functionality is crucial for creating the peer network required for file sharing. I coded together with my group to debug and implement different areas of the program.
